<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>As a team we plan to make a productivity management tool.</p>

<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
<p>Allow all people to effortlessly manage any task effectively.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> We are all students with busy schedules and life events on
    the side. We hope to help people keep track of all the 
    challenges they are facing moment by moment, day by day,
    year to year. Effortlessly keeping track of progess and goals.</p>

<h2>Risks:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Dependencies like google calendar, wunderlist, etc.</li>
	<li>Each team member carrying responsibilities creates a certain amount of risk of not completing it... deadlines and the failure to meet them</li>
	<li>Whatever the choice of infrastructure is, the learning curve could be too steep</li>
	<li>There are a lot of Productivity management apps out there. It's going to be hard to make it more unique.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk Mitigation Plan</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Software Development Methodology</h2>
<p>We intend to use the Agile methodology in order to quickly
    adapt to adjustments in the project requirements that will
    inevitably arise as new challenges present themselves.</p>
