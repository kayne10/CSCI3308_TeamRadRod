Show some stats about office hour attendence

Hi, I'm Nate from Group Up

We all live very busy lives. College students try to balance their health, work, and class.
Often times, this doesn't leave much time for office hours.

Taking a survery amongst our team, we've found that up to 85% of the time, office hours
conflict with other responsibilities, such as work. These time constraints make attending office hours
or collaborating with other students incredibly difficult.

Here at GroupUp, our goal is to make sure you can use those resources.
We want to make office hours easier to attend, and make meeting up with other
students a much quicker, and easier process. 

We want to students the power to collaborate and communicate in such a way
that's beneficial to not only the students, but to the instructors too.
