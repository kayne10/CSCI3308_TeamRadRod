Description:
    As a team we plan to make a productivity management tool.

Vision Statement:
    To help students become more productive in their studies.

Motivation:
    We are all students with busy schedules and life events on
    the side. We hope to help people keep track of all the
    challenges they are facing moment by moment, day by day,
    year to year. Effortlessly keeping track of progess and goals.

Risks:
    We may encounter risks when learning to work with different
    dependencies when creating our project, such as integrating
    google calendar support, or working with the Wunderlist API.
    We may also face challenges when learning to work with new
    tools, such as Jango and MongoDB. Learning these tools will
    take time, and they may have a steep learning curve.

Risk Mitigation Plan:
    To help mitigate risks, we plan on choosing tools that members
    of our group are familiar with, this will allow for sharing of
    information amongst all of our group. It will make the learning
    curve less severe. We will have backup plans incase it becomes 
    too difficult or takes too long to integrate different products
    into our project.

Software Development Methodology:
    We intend to use the Agile methodology in order to quickly
    adapt to adjustments in the project requirements that will
    inevitably arise as new challenges present themselves.
